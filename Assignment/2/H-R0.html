   <h1> No trip to Hyderabad is complete without trying the cityâ€™s famous biryani. This dish is a combination of long-grain rice, meat (usually chicken or mutton), and a blend of spices. Hyderabadi biryani is cooked in a sealed pot, which allows the flavours to infuse and the rice to cook to perfection.
