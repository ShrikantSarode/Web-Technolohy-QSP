        Delhi,[a] officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a
        city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of
        India. Straddling the Yamuna river, primarily its western or right bank,
        Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and
        with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. The NCT covers an
        area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi).[5] According to the 2011
        census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million,[14][15]
        while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million.[16] Delhi's urban
        agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad,
        Gurgaon and Noida in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR),
        has an estimated population of over 28 million, making it the largest
        metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after
        Tokyo).[17] The topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks
        of the river Yamuna matches the literary description of the citadel
        Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata; however, excavations in
        the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment. From
        the early 13th century until the mid-19th century, Delhi was the capital
        of two major empires, the Delhi sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which
        covered large parts of South Asia. All three UNESCO World Heritage Sites
        in the city, the Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort, belong
        to this period. Delhi was the early centre of Sufism and Qawwali music.
        The names of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khusrau are prominently
        associated with it. The Khariboli dialect of Delhi was part of a
        linguistic development that gave rise to the literature of the Urdu
        language and then of Modern Standard Hindi.

        The national flag of India, colloquially called the tricolour, is a
        horizontal rectangular tricolour flag, the colours being of India
        saffron, white and India green; with the Ashoka Chakra, a 24-spoke
        wheel, in navy blue at its centre.[1][2] It was adopted in its present
        form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947,
        and it became the official flag of the Dominion of India on 15 August
        1947. The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of
        India. In India, the term "tricolour" almost always refers to the Indian
        national flag. The flag is based on the Swaraj flag, a flag of the
        Indian National Congress designed by Pingali Venkayya.
