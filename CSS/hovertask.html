              The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup
              language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
              It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often
              assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
              scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML
              documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
              documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
              of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its
              appearance. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
              With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive
              forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a
              means to create structured documents by denoting structural
              semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
              quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
              written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce
              content into the page. Other tags such assurround and provide
              information about document text and may include sub-element tags.
              Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret
              the content of the page.

              Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
              describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
              language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
              MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
              Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to
              enable the separation of content and presentation, including
              layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content
              accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
              specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
              pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
              separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
              structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to
              improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
              and its formatting. Separation of formatting and content also
              makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
              styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in
              print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and
              on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate
              formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4] The
              name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
              determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a
              particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
              The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web
              Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is
              registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C
              operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5] In
              addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS
              including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in GTK
              widget toolkit.

              JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a
              programming language that is one of the core technologies of the
              World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of
              websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
              behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major
              web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the
              code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often
              just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
              standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based
              object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
              multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and
              imperative programming styles. It has application programming
              interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
              expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object
              Model (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not include any
              input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
              facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system
              provides JavaScript APIs for I/O. JavaScript engines were
              originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components
              of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular
              runtime system for this usage is Node.js. Although Java and
              JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard
              libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in
              design.

              components. React applications typically consist of many layers of
              components. The components are rendered to a root element in the
              DOM using the React DOM library. When rendering a component,
              values are passed between components through props (short for
              "properties"). Values internal to a component are called its
              state.[12] The two primary ways of declaring components in React
              are through function Routing React itself does not come with
              built-in support for routing. React is primarily a library for
              building user interfaces, and it doesn't include a full-fledged
              routing solution out of the box. However, there are popular
              third-party libraries that can be used to handle routing in React
              applications. One such library is react-router, which provides a
              comprehensive routing solution for React applications.[24] It
              allows you to define routes, manage navigation, and handle URL
              changes in a React-friendly way. To use react-router, you need to
              install it as a separate package and integrate it into your React
              application.
